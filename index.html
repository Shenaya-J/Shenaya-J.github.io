            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>The Puple Orchid Group, which was established in 2008, focuses on the administration of hotels and
                restaurants as well as the advancement of indigenous crafts.
                Its objective is to provide tourists a thorough understanding of Sri Lanka; hence, it currently has a
                range of branches dispersed around Sri Lanka's breathtaking landscapes. Because we believe that every
                tourist is different,
                Purple Orchid Hotel makes every effort to cater our services to your preferences.
                <br> Ayubowan, I wish you a long life!
            </p>
